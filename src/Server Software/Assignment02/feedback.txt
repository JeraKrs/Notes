"This is an excellent piece of work with an appropriate extension that solves a number of issues with the provided code and fuses theory and application to yield a powerful extension. Well done - excellent work which demonstrates a first rate understanding of the subject matter.

Report *********************************************************
Basic report is a little long (1/3 column in 2 column format). 
The logic is well explained as is the structure and correctness of the code


Static Code Analysis ********************************************

Race conditions: none
Efficiency: excellent, especially with extension 
Error checking: All present
Robustness: No issues found

Function Size: Could be slightly shorter, but commenting makes this appear greater than it is.
Indentation: Consistent
Comments: excellent



Test basic funcitonality:

{ echo ""count""; sleep 1; echo ""put name robert""; sleep 1; echo ""count""; sleep 1; echo ""put nameson peter""; sleep 1; echo ""count""; sleep 1; echo ""get name""; sleep 1;  echo ""exists nameson""; sleep 1;  echo ""count""; sleep 1;  echo ""delete name""; sleep 1;  echo ""exists name""; sleep 1;} | telnet localhost 4001

************
PASS
************

Test overwriting:

{ echo ""put name robert""; sleep 1; echo ""count""; sleep 1; echo ""put name rupert""; sleep 1; echo ""count""; sleep 1; echo ""get name""; sleep 1;} | telnet localhost 4001

************
PASS
************

Test 4 clients connected on data port simulataneously:

-> Add name robert term 1
-> get name term 2
-> delete name term 2
-> get name term 1
-> get name term 4

*************
Pass
*************

Check 5th client is queued:

*************
Pass
*************


Test control port:

Client is 'stuck' and can only exit by sending shutdown signal (this is fine).
Shutdown with no clients connected

************
PASS
************

shutdown with clients connected

************
PASS - clients keep server alive whilst connected which is expected behaviour for basic implementation

Comments:  +Everything works properly +High quality code, report and extension"


EXTENSION

"Skiplist implmented to improve efficiency of KV store. Has excellent documentation. Additionally an number of issues with the original KV store have been attended to and fixed. 

This is a relatively signficant extension, both in terms of code written, documentation and theory. "
